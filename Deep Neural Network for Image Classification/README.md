# Deep Neural Network for Image Classification
This code is a deep learning model for image classification. Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

1. **Importing necessary libraries and modules**: You're importing libraries such as numpy, matplotlib, scipy, and PIL that are necessary for data manipulation, visualization, and computation. The `dnn_app_utils_v3` is likely a module containing utility functions for deep learning.

2. **Loading the data**: `load_data()` is a function that loads your training and testing data.

3. **Visualizing the data**: You're visualizing an example from your dataset using matplotlib's `imshow` function.

4. **Exploring the dataset**: You're printing out the shapes of your training and testing datasets to understand their structure.

5. **Preprocessing the data**: You're flattening the images (which are in the shape of (num_px, num_px, 3)) into a single vector of shape (num_px \* num_px \* 3, 1). Then, you're standardizing the data.

6. **Defining the model structure**: You're defining the number of input units (n_x), the number of hidden units (n_h), and the number of output units (n_y). These are then stored in a tuple called `layers_dims`.

7. **Building the model**: You've defined two functions, `two_layer_model` and `L_layer_model`, which are used to build a 2-layer neural network and an L-layer deep neural network, respectively.

8. **Making predictions**: You're using the `predict` function to make predictions on your training and testing datasets.

9. **Identifying mislabeled images**: You're using the `print_mislabeled_images` function to print out images that your model has misclassified.

This code is a typical example of a deep learning workflow. You load and preprocess your data, define your model, then train it on your data. After training, you can use your model to make predictions on new data.
